This project is aimed at implementing all the basic data structures and algorithms from "The Algorithm Design Manual" by Steven S. Skiena in Rust. The first phase of the project is to gain a more solid understanding of DSA and the Rust programming language. The second phase will be to compare the reliability and speed of my implementations to those of basic Python libraries and see whether I did a good job.

## Why Rust?

Rust is a programming language that aims to be fast, safe, and reliable. It is blazingly fast and memory-efficient, with no runtime or garbage collector, making it ideal for performance-critical services, embedded devices, and integration with other languages. Rust's rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety, enabling you to eliminate many classes of bugs at compile-time. Rust also has great documentation, a friendly compiler with useful error messages, and top-notch tooling, making it a productive language to work with.

## To Do

- Implement a user interface to visually demonstrate how the data structures and algorithms work. This will make it easier for users of the library to understand the inner workings of the algorithms and data structures.
- Perform a performance comparison with the standard library in Python. This will help us understand how our implementations stack up against established libraries in terms of speed and efficiency.
